So, you are probably here for the arb commands. Well here they are:


bringbot - brings the bot to you
walkbot - bot will walk to you
saybot - makes the bot say something
heybot "anything here" - takes what you say and searches the database for the question.
shutdown "shutdown code" - shuts the bot down if code is recieved.

We are currently making this better every day!
